# GoVMAX

## Overview
```GoVMAX``` represents API bindings for Go that allow you to manage VMAX
block platforms.  In the true nature of API bindings, it is intended that the
functions available are basically a direct implementation of what is available
through the API.  

The bindings also include VMware vSphere functionality to enable use cases
when mapping VMAX storage to RDMs on VMs.

## API Compatibility
Currently only tested with VMAX3.

## Examples
The package was written using test files, so these can be looked at for a more
comprehensive view of how to implement the different functions.

Intialize a new client

    smis, err = New(host, port, insecure, username, password)


### Some Volume Examples

Get Storage Arrays

    arraySIDs, err := smis.GetStorageArrays()
	...
	mySID = arraySIDs[index]

Get Storage Instance Name

    myArrayName, err := smis.GetStorageInstanceName(mySID)

Get Storage Pools

    pools, err := smis.GetStoragePools(myArrayName)


Get Volumes

    vols, err := smis.GetVolumes(myArrayName)



For example usage you can see the [REX-Ray](https://github.com/emccode/rexray)
repo.  There, the ```govmax``` package is used to implement a
```Volume Manager``` across multiple storage platforms. This includes managing
multipathing, mounts, and filesystems.

## Environment Variables
